# toDo App with Vue using options API

## A fully functional EXAMPLE project written in vue.js, SCSS and HTML using pinia for state management.

This project was built to advance my vue.js knowledge and showcase my logical thinking, because it was written on my own. This app:

* has input field, if empty, gives a warning message. If data is submitted it updates the list.
* you can finish your task and move it to other side or delete it, you can reverse the task if you changed your mind.
* I took one step further and implemented 'favorite' tasks and you can toggle between 'favorite' and all tasks.
